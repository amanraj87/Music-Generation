# Music Generation with RNNs

This project explores building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation. The model is trained to learn patterns in raw sheet music in ABC notation and then generate new music.

## Libraries and Frameworks

The following libraries and frameworks are used in this project:

- **TensorFlow:** Used for building and training the RNN model.
- **Comet ML:** Used for tracking model development and training runs.
- **MIT Deep Learning Package (mitdeeplearning):** Provides helper functions and utilities for deep learning tasks.
- **NumPy:** Used for numerical computations.
- **SciPy:** Used for scientific computing and technical computing.
- **tqdm:** Used for displaying progress bars.
- **abcmidi:** Used for converting ABC notation to MIDI format.
- **timidity:** Used for synthesizing MIDI files to audio.
